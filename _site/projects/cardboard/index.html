		<p>Just like any artist I can stare at a blank piece of paper for hours when I'm bogged down. Sometimes the high level of expectations draw me back from creating anything. When I get to this point, I start developing the project in high details, get too deep in the weeds, and the product comes up short of its potential. I needed another approach to my design process where starting isn't so demanding. So, I created my very own canvases to hash out as many possibilites I can visualize.</p>

		<p>If you're an ambitious soul who simply wants to explore ideas on a low cost of time and energy you should try this out. All you have to do is get rid of those hand me downs and cut up some devices!</p>

		<h4>The phone</h4>
		<img src="/img/work/cardboard/phone.jpg">
		<p>I used an Amazon Fire Phone to model this phone. <strike>The one thing that Amazon phone is useful for. </strike>The best thing about designing on this model is that you can feel what the appropriate sizes of the call-to-actions need to be. It also forces to really think about visual hierachy and prioritize what the necessary elements should be when you resize the screen to this size.</p>
		<h4>The tablet</h4>
		<img src="/img/work/cardboard/tablet.jpg">
		<p>This is my favorite of all the models. At 7" of screen size you can sketch out the minimum width of desktop screens and it's the popular option when displaying my iterations to my teammates.</p>
		<img style="max-width: 40rem; width: 100%; margin: auto;" src="/img/work/cardboard/demo.jpg">
		<h4>The desktop</h4>
		<img src="/img/work/cardboard/desktop.jpg">
		<p>Still got some room? Add some post-stick notes as modals. It's quite large at a whopping 20" so it may be very difficult to envision elements here. Normally when I design for responsiveness I just let elements scale up in size and the same structure is maintained from a minimum of 1024px in width. This model forces me to add more features if I have the freedom to do so.</p>

		<p>At Major League Hacking, we had a big project of redesigning our events page. As the number of events increased on the old layout it was becoming time consuming to scroll through hundreds of modals on the screen. The goal of the design is to reduce the time it took to scan through the events while enabling users to filter and search.</p>

		<p>The mockup went through 7 iterations in 6 business days. <a href="https://mlh.io/events">Visit the season page</a></p>
