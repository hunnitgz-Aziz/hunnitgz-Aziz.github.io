<p>Hackcon is the student hackathon organizer conference powered by Major League Hacking. Students organizers across all regions in the league unite to share knowledge on making the hackathon community better for the future while making new friends. As the creative director of Major League Hacking my responsibility was to make the brand as dope as possible.</p>

<h3 id="the-feel-main-ingredients">The Feel (Main Ingredients)</h3>

<p>One of my favorite stages of crafting a brand identity is getting a feel of what your audience and partners are envisioning. I always feel like psychiatrist asking numerous questions and hearing my opposition’s perspective of how things could work in the design process. Everything is honest and easier to consume. I was a sponge in all the meetings with the event managers and student hackathon organizers who have been a part of Hackcon for a while.</p>

<h4 id="brand-values">Brand Values</h4>

<p><strong>1. Diversity:</strong> This year’s Hackcon is open to all student hackathon organizers old and new. The goal was to make sure no one feels left out and that is okay to not know everything. This is the place to be informed and spread the knowledge across the globe to those who are willing to contribute in the growth of the community. Hackcon is zigging the zag where it’s not your typical tech conference, it’s a room full of passionate and like minded people hanging out for the weekend.</p>

<p><strong>2. Inclusivity:</strong> Being open to all is one thing, but giving your audience an opportunity to express themselves is the next level. We encourage all members to speak and introduce new ideas to the community holding their own discussions and keynotes in the schedule. The platform is open for leadership and we make sure it’s approachable and attainable for anyone who is interested.</p>

<p><strong>3. Friendships are important:</strong> The platform is created to allow members to make potential long last friendships. This is the magic that makes our members come back to see each other again even outside of the tech world.</p>

<p><strong>4. Timeless:</strong> Our goal in the leadership board was to make a system out of the Hackcon brand. We wanted a consistent brand that’ll be recognized for many years to come.</p>

<h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3>

<p>Now at this point I had all these values engrained in my system <del>and a large list of projects to kill in 2-3months</del> yet I was still swamped looking for the right equation to execute this whole thing well.</p>

<h4 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h4>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/92053056/hackcon_img.jpg" alt="Hackcon North America" /></p>

<h4 class="text-center"><a href="http://hackcon.io">Visit the Site</a></h4>

<p>It started off by designing the landing page and crafting the logo. The logo was originally made as a placeholder when I was designing the site, but then it just fit and I ran with it. The logo type font was ‘Raisonne’. I liked it because the lowercase letters were kinda circular and the overall font was playful and bold.</p>

<h4 id="brand-inspiration">Brand Inspiration</h4>

<p>I fed off of the vibes in Boulder and Estes Park. I imagined the audience feeling the presence of the mountains and landscape. During the time of branding Hackcon, I watched <em>The Rugrats Movie</em>. I remember as a kid the woods had dark colors and the trees had jagged edges. That element put me in the right mood for that nostalgic feel along with watching <em>Camp Lazlo</em>. This show had the right amount of free form edges and a color palette I could rock with.</p>

<p>I then chose camping and mountains as the motif. Bob Ross made me feel right at home making mountains and happy little trees. The camping theme is recognizable and such a vast theme to delve in to.</p>

<h3 id="in-action">In Action</h3>

<p>I was extremely thrilled to see everyone interact with the products. The shirts were definitely my favorite part because it was different and a supreme novelty.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3>

<p>Communicating with the event managers and contributing hackathon organizers was key. I felt included in the process and their visions were understood. I felt trusted with where I was going in the branding process from start to finish. I also wasn’t afraid to ask for help when I hit a wall. It’s good to give that trust in your teammates right back when you brainstorm with them.</p>
