		<p>Living in this generation of constant output of creativity there seems to be no room left for originality. It's like *everything's taken* in that department. I always wondered what would happen if the individuals of the Renaissance Era had the internet. We're sort of living in it now. Large amounts of work is being produced. Individuals are more cross disciplinary and versatile in their skill sets. I just stop and think of how we're evolving is all. I believe in discovering something for me that'll create my own evolution.</p>
