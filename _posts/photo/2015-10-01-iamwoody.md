The relationship between Woody and I started in my senior year in college. He was a birthday gift to myself at 22 and he was there in the most pressuring moments of my life trying to figure out where my passion was. ~~I'm still trying to figure that out right now.~~ All I knew at this point in time was that I needed him around me to keep my sanity and fully express myself in this abrupt transition into adulthood.

These photographs mark the beginning of a bond that will never be broken because he is the one that has given me what I coveted most: **freedom.** Now that our relationship has grown, a sense of urgency to continue expressing myself has developed. There are certain personal changes that have to be made in order to do so...

*A new chapter will inspire these changes*
