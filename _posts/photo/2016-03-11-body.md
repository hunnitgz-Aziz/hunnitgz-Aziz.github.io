I'm the type of person that would rather have a messy room. Things take up space and it shows that someone exists within it. You can tell by the bed, laundry dispersed everywhere, collectibles always in the way, and never being able to find your day-to-day items like your house keys and wallet. I spent lots of time alone and I needed something other than material possessions taking up my room. 


At the time I thought it'd be great to have a human sized version of Woody as extension to my studies. Well, not exactly a human sized Woody doll, but something larger that'll give me freedom to manipulate limbs and such. I figured since my closet is vacant I'd get mannequins to practice with. Lots of stores were going out of business in the spring time so I helped them by taking some of their display models home. 

#### The Abstract

I wanted to place my mannequins in outer space. That's it. Nothing more. Nothing less. I felt it was time after a year of photography to step out of the box and play with simple pictoral cues in depth perception. It was also a good time to tackle some low key photography techniques to pin point where one light source is affecting my subjects.  

#### The Process 

The magic happened in my office space. Setup started at approximately 10pm. My two awesome friends and photograph assistants were Jon Astacio (creative director of <a href="http://goodartsucks.com/">Good Art Sucks</a>) and Amber Figueroa (editor at The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore). We propped up some backdrop stands, a bunch of wood planks from Home Depot, and a ton of microfilament fishing lines to hold the planets (mannequin parts) and shapes orbiting around them. The setup took a couple of hours in which the first shot was taken at 2am.

#### Stargazing 

It felt wonderful taking these shots. My camera was a telescope gazing at the stars at night. Although the frames are far from the appearance of the actual night sky, it was satisfying to relieve of my creative tension to see this idea unfold.

#### The Outtakes

These are some extra takes to further explore what was on my mind at the time.

*Special shout out Jon & Amber, I wouldn't have been able to do this alone. Y'all stuck with me all nite til 5am to make sure I accomplished my goal. Last but not least, shout out to my lovely girlfriend for blessing your boy with that Michael's gift card. I made the most of the opportunity you gave me to do this.*
