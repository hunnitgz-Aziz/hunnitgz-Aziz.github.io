Me and my friends run a blog called Museache, a place for artistic expression, sound, visual arts, and a hub for the underground art scene to connect with each other. We get submissions from all over the world like Germany and the Netherlands. We've put on great musical showcases for our community. We also go around the country to make personal connections with the artists we really support and geniunely love. The main issue with blogs today in music and visual arts is that there's so much fluff in these bloggers' write ups. No one is doing any justice for these artists. I thought what if we made a stronger platform where we can cut the nonsense talk and just let the people play the music that we really like. We'll put it in rotation like a radio station every week.
