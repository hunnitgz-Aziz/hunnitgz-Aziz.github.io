When you're fresh out of ideas to get inspired to make something new on the web, tinkering with CMS websites are the way to go. Or if your brother is one of the best designers on the map, he'll definitely give you a challenge. The kids these days always need a nice fit to show off their content and attract others to mindlessly scroll through their Tumblrs for hours on end. He presented this super clean design in a psd and I thought it'll be amazing to see this happen in real life.

#### The Outcome

It was exciting to see we got good reviews on creative market. The most exciting thing about this project was building relationships with the people who needed help with customizations. My favorite people were Phil & Lui, lifestyle/fashion bloggers from Germany. They needed lots of help on the customization end as far as enabling them to create the changes they wanted. It got to a point where they needed lots of changes. So, I did some further research on how Tumblr themes come with default customizations such as the title and site description. You can create your own toggable features by creating meta tags.

All you do is add a meta tag within the head of your html with these. Look at the first line below. This will be the theme option Phil & Lui would like to edit. They would like change the color of the hover buttons of the like and reblog buttons to match the feel of their site. The content is default color when you first open the theme.

{% highlight html lineos %}

<meta name="color:Like Reblog Button Hover" content="#22dbad"/>
<meta name="color:Menu Background" content="#1f2021"/>
<meta name="color:Sidebar Title Color" content="#3c3939"/>

{% endhighlight %}

Next in your CSS, all you do is add the placeholder a property of the class it is affecting. 

{% highlight css lineos %}
.entry .post-buttons a:hover,
.entry .photo .photo-buttons a:hover{
    background: {color:Like Reblog Button Hover};
    }

{% endhighlight %}

And BAM they had their very own virtual palette to find the color that suits them.

#### The Takeaway

I learned a great deal making this happen. Reading documentation is very important as well as patience in front end development. You always have the vision of the outcome, but there are millions of things to gear up for as you're making it happen. It's all about the process.
