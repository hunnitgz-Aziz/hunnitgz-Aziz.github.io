The hardware lab is one of Major League Hacking's amazing gifts provided to the hacker community. The inventory consists of the latest wearables and microcontrollers. We've gotten thousands of checkouts over the course of 2 years in our hackathons. Now that our community has grown so much, the amount of checkouts and attendance at these events have increased significantly. 

#### The Objective

The goal here is to make the hardware checkout process more efficient, make it mobile friendly, and easy to use for any volunteer at the event to hop on quickly when moderators need assistance. The user experience motive was to make sure both admin and hacker didn't have to input information by type, but with more clicking, selecting, and toggling. 

#### For the Hacker

The first sketch below demonstrates the first page when a user hops on to the hardware lab. He/she will see a list of events currently happening that weekend and they will select the one they are attending. The following sketch which the next screen lists the inventory for the selected event.

These two features already reduce the time and effort as a moderator significantly at the lab because now users can access it via link (<a href="http://hardware.mlh.io">hardware.mlh.io</a>). The whole problem of waiting in line behind someone who needs to register their whole biography to pick up hardware is nonexistent. They can do away from the lab and come pick up their reservation when they're ready.

Another key moment on the hacker side was to give them an opportunity to double check their reservation before they commit it.

#### For the Admin

We want the admins to feel at ease managing all of this valuable hardware as well. Just count the inventory and check how many items each has been checked out and returned by each hacker.
