My name is Aziz. Not like Aziz Ansari though. I live in the Renaissance Era and I believe in learning everything to evolve along with society for generations to come. I learn by doing. 

I made this site using Jekyll and gave it some proper context as opposed to last time where it was just a joke. Here you will see all my works that I'm extremely proud of and this is proof of my existence.
