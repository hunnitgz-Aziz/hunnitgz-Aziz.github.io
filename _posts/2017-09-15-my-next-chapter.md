Today marks my final day as a member of Major League Hacking and I will taking my talents to Universal Music Group (NYC) as a Web Designer.

This has been an incredible three years. I can still vividly remember when I sent a direct message to Swift's (MLH CEO) email asking if there were job opportunities laying around in the community. He said MLH is looking for a designer and he believed it was me that can develop the brand. I gave Major League Hacking all my efforts because they believed in me even until this very day.

With all the hard work, connections, and personal growth it was only right to take on a new challenge. But I will never forget where I launched from.

A big shout out goes to Swift and Jon. Words can't describe how thankful I am to have had this opportunity to start my career. That's all I needed to live my life as a man.

<br>

Thank you, MLH.
