		<p><a href="http://museache.com" target="_blank" class="und-hover">Museache</a> and I teamed up to work with NJ's up and coming music festival, <a href="http://www.madliberationfestival.com/" target="_blank" class="und-hover">Madliberation.</a> Museache contributed <strike>amongst many other services</strike> stage design and stage management for a weekend of 48 hours of non-stop music. Our main focus for stage design and management was to come up with a structure that'll prevent rain from damaging all equipment on the stage from the rainstorm we faced. On top of that I had a crazy itch to test my abilities and create a wall with windows to display some awesome graphics I can toggle through. So I teamed up Bldy Rxse' fashion and visual designer, Kwabena Boachie to splash some of the animations that he had stashed in the vault.</p>

		<p>We had just a little over 48 hours prior to the first performance on Friday to complete this mission.</p>

		<p>We added a large 20'x30' blue tarp and stapled it to the studs drilled into the platform.</p>

		<h4>The Wall</h4>
		<p>The final touch to the stage added life to the performances late at night. How was it made? A truck load of 1/4" plywood sheets to cover the studs that held the wall and some bedsheets for screens. The visual DJ set up was a mere node.js Gulp starter app with a drag-and-resize tool that allowed me to move the videos as I pleased. Note: I had to make this before landing on the campgrounds because there was neither cellular nor internet connnecion. Lastly, just a projector to beam Kwabena's graphics on the wall.</p>
