		<p><a href="http://museache.com/">Museache,</a> is a group of creative souls who specialize in visual and media arts along with stage design. We're on a mission to solve problems for the DIY art &amp; music community. Well, it didn't start off this way in which it was a blog solely for media consumption. Below is what it used to look like.</p>

		<p>Using <a href="https://www.upstatement.com/timber/">Timber</a> is absolutely amazing. <a href="https://www.upstatement.com/">Upstatement,</a> one of my favorite creative agencies, made this tool to make Wordpress development faster and smarter using Twig Template Engine. Using this tool enforced me to adhere to the DRY (don't repeat yourself) and MVC principles in my markup. With the integration of Gulp and SASS, this is an ultimate baby-making experience.</p>

		<h4>Challenges</h4>
		<p>Despite how flawless the documentation is, I found pagination to be very difficult to integrate on static pages. For this arrangement of content there was a little twist in plugging the function into the PHP file that renders Twig template. If you have a Home and Blog and you'd like to use pagination on your Blog page try this method:</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
//home.php

$context = Timber::get_context();
$post = new TimberPost();
$context['post'] = $post;

if ( is_front_page() && is_home() ) {
  // Default homepage
} elseif ( is_front_page() ) {
  // static homepage
  $args = array(
      'posts_per_page' => 2
  );
  $context['posts'] = Timber::get_posts($args);

  
} elseif ( is_home() ) {
  // blog page
	$args = array(
      'posts_per_page' => 12
  );

  $args = array_merge( $args, array( 'paged' => $paged ) );
  $context['posts'] = Timber::get_posts($args);
  $context['pagination'] = Timber::get_pagination($args);
  query_posts($args);
  query_posts('paged='.$paged);

} else {
  //everyting else
}

Timber::render(array('page-' . $post->post_name . '.twig', 'page-home.twig'), $context);
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>When using the static page arrangement you're using a page template. Since home.php is the first page template page-blog.php functions were only able to be called from there. And it had to be in this logical order for the pagination function to work.</p>
