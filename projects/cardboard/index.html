		<h1>Exploring your project needs. Now.</h1>
		<p>My experiment on making design more fun</p>

		<p>Have you ever designed something and worked really hard for your friends or clients and it's not what they wanted? Have you ever been bogged down in the initial stage of the project due to high level of expectations you put on yourself? Do you need some inspiration on how make your design process more fun? Excuse me for using the word design because that term may exclude people who don't think they're one of us. These tools are for everyone in the world. If you're an ambitious soul who simply wants to explore ideas on a low cost of time and energy you should try this out. All you have to do is get rid of those hand me downs and cut up some devices!</p>

		<h4>The phone</h4>
		<img src="/img/work/cardboard/phone.jpg">
		<p>I used an Amazon Fire Phone to model this phone. <strike>Finally, the one thing that Amazon phone is useful for. </strike>The best thing about designing on this model is that you can feel what the appropriate sizes of the call-to-actions need to be. It also forces to really think about visual hierachy and prioritize what the necessary elements should be when you resize the screen to this size.</p>
		<h4>The tablet</h4>
		<img src="/img/work/cardboard/tablet.jpg">
		<p>This is my favorite of all the models. At 7" of screen size you can sketch out the minimum width of desktop screens and it's the popular option when displaying my iterations to my teammates.</p>

		<h4>The desktop</h4>
		<img src="/img/work/cardboard/desktop.jpg">
		<p>Still got some room? Add some post-stick notes as modals. It's quite large at a whopping 20" so it may be very difficult to envision elements here. Normally when I design for responsiveness I just let elements scale up in size and the same structure is maintained from a minimum of 1024px in width. This model forces me to add more features if I have the freedom to do so.</p>
